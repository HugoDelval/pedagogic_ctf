But if you are quick enough you can login just before this entry is inserted.\n\nThis attack is called a 'race condition' and is really common in API-like application.\nYou should always use transaction when your database can be in a instable state.\n\nHint : use curl :\ncurl 'http(s)://thishost.com/v1.0/challenge/race_condition/execute' -d '{\"action\":\"register\",\"login\":\"testlogin\",\"password\":\"testlogin\"}'\ncurl 'http(s)://thishost.com/v1.0/challenge/race_condition/execute' -d '{\"action\":\"login\",\"login\":\"testlogin\",\"password\":\"testlogin\"}'",
